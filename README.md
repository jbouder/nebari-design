The assets are available in two formats (PNG & SVG) and in three layouts --

and [symbol (which does not include the name and is square)](./symbol/), and at least 3 versions (color, white text, & colored background).

You can find the assets in the following locations:

- [Nebari Symbol](./symbol/)
- [Nebari horizontal logo mark](./logo-mark/horizontal/)
- [Nebari stacked logo mark](./logo-mark/stacked/)
- [Nebari logo mark with colored backgrounds](./logo-mark/colored-background/)
